/*
Compare between binary search and linear search in terms of
performance and
best case and
worst case and
average case.
*/


/*
* linear search and binary search are used in arrays to search the elements
* binary search elements must be sorted but in linear search elements can be random
* binary search take less time to search than linear search
* efficiency of binary search method is greater than linear search.

time complexity           O(log2n)                       O(n)
best case time            middle element O(1)            first element O(1)
worst case time           N comparisons are required     log2N comparisons are required
